- ✅ Face enrollment system
- ✅ Face recognition attendance
- ✅ Attendance history tracking
- ✅ Teacher dashboard with reports
- ✅ Student management
- ✅ Export functionality (CSV)
- ✅ Real-time attendance status

### 🔧 Setup Required

#### Database Setup (Supabase)
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Open your project dashboard
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Run the SQL commands from `supabase/schema.sql`
5. This will create the required tables with proper security

#### Environment Configuration
All environment variables are already configured in `.env.local`

### 📱 How to Use

#### For Students:
1. **Register**: Create account with role "Student"
2. **Enroll Face**: Go to "Enroll Face" and capture your face
3. **Mark Attendance**: Use "Mark Attendance" with face recognition
4. **View History**: Check your attendance records

#### For Teachers:
1. **Register**: Create account with role "Teacher"
2. **View Dashboard**: See today's attendance summary
3. **Manage Students**: View all registered students
4. **Generate Reports**: Export attendance data

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture

#### Frontend Stack:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with React 18
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Camera**: React Webcam
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast

#### Backend Stack:
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Face Recognition**: face_recognition library
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Image Processing**: Pillow
- **Database**: Supabase client
- **CORS**: Enabled for localhost:3000

### 🔒 Security Features
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user management
- **Role-based Access Control**: Student/Teacher separation
- **Liveness Detection**: Basic anti-spoofing
- **Face Encoding Storage**: Only mathematical representations stored
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control

### 📊 Demo Mode
The system currently runs in demo mode with:
- ✅ Face recognition simulation
- ✅ Attendance tracking simulation
- ✅ All UI functionality working
- ⚠️ Database operations simulated (until Supabase setup)

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Set up Supabase database** using provided schema
2. **Test with real users** by registering accounts
3. **Enroll faces** for students
4. **Test attendance marking** with face recognition
5. **Generate reports** for teachers

### 🐛 Known Issues
- Face recognition models may need additional setup on some systems
- Supabase connection requires manual database schema setup
- Camera permissions needed for face enrollment/recognition

### 📞 Support
- Check `README.md` for detailed setup instructions
- Run `python test_api.py` to verify backend functionality
- Check browser console for frontend debugging
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
